        <div class="pictureText">Early Australian stamps had little focus on use to attract tourists. This stamp from
            1936 is one of the earlier stamps to show land and natural beauty. Prior to this, most stamps were stylized
            Kangaroos, pictures of royalty or various commemorations of history. Even this stamp, while different from
            previous stamps, focused on commemoration.<br><br>

            National Park in New South Wales, one of a set of 3 National Park stamps. While likely targeted at domestic
            tourists, stamps such as these brought new venues into evreyday focus.<br><br>

            clearly aimed at selling the country to foreign tourists. About 30 different International Post stamps were
            issued between 2000 and today.<br><br>
